> What is a Data Structure?

A data structure (DS) is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively.

The data structure name indicates itself that organizing data in memory. There are many ways of organizing the data in the memory as we have already seen one of the data structures, i.e.,array in C language. Array is a collection of memory element in

> Why Data Structures?

They are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms~算法~.

They help to manage and organize data.

They make code cleaner and easier to understand.

# Abstract data types

An abstract data type (ADP) is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to.

The interface does not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language. 

# Big-O Notation

Big-O Notation gives an upper bound of the complexity in the worst case, helping to quantify performance as the input size becomes arbitrarily large.
